        Graduated in psychology, but with a great passion for
        art and graphic design since a young age, after high school I taught myself
        how to use some of the most commonly used softwares in the digital art field,
        such as Photoshop, Illustrator and Indesign. 
        After following some online courses I enrolled in a three-year school,
        thanks to which I learned the basics of design and started to actually
        work not only with my knowledge but also my creativity. 
        Due to work reasons i had to interrupt my studies, but the time spent away from
        my passions only rekindled my will to learn and improve. This time
        I aimed for something that I'd always thought was out of my reach, coding and programming.

    <h1>LETTERING</h1>

    The creation of this lettering required a wide research
    over a lot of different styles, ranging from complex and articulated
    to simple and linear ones. After numerous sketches that aimed to mostly employ smooth 
    lines and shapes, I came to the realisation that focusing on more geometrical
    compositions came both easier and natural to me. During the early stages of planning the design
    got through many corrections and changes, since instead of constructing every
    letter from the same pool of shapes I opted to create them following a broad set
    of rules aimed to make them as cohesive as possible. The more common themes are
    the multiple "rays" that start from the same point used for the letters wich
    are mostly comprised by straight lines, and the combination of said rays with
    circumferences for letters that presented one or more curves. This specific
    lettering was not created for a specific usage, but given its characteristics
    and the fact that it becomes very hard to read when shrunk it is best suited 
    for titles or similar tasks that require a larger font size to maximise
    its impact on the reader.

    <p>This project focuses around the theme of esotericism, a term that refers
    to sets of beliefs that are by their own nature "closed off" to the great majority of the population.
    This specific project was made for an hypotetical esoteric shop, a place that sells items
    related to various cults including, but not limited to, paganism, hinduism, wicca and buddhism.
    Given the great amount of cults and their vast usage of iconography, the hardest part of the project was
    choosing a very limited number of symbols to work with; for this purpose, the Baphomet and the eye
    were chosen given their widespread usage and recognizability even from people with no interest in the
    subject. The specific colors chosen are black, purple, gold and silver, both for their meaning and
    because of the chromatic combination.</p>

    <div class="colors">
    <ul> 
    <li>Black for purification.</li>
    <li>Purple for protection and sensitivity.</li>
    <li>Gold to attract fortune.</li>
    <li>Silver for meditation.</li>

    <p>This school project, unfortunately interrupted, tasked us with the choice
        of a company that, thanks to the general aesthetics of its products,
        had caught our attention, giving us the inspiration
        for the development of a poster, a moodboard and some gadgets. 
        Since "SNEAK" produces energy drinks for gamers
        I opted for bright colors and regular and edgy shapes, characteristics
        frequently associated with the videogame scene. 
        During the early stages of the project
        I suggested many can designs that eventually became the ones shown above. 
        In the third picture you can see a draft of what would be 
        the final poster with a can model built in Blender and then inserted 
        in illustrator.

    <p>There isn't much to say about me personally. I'm a huge nerd with a passion
         for videogames, mangas, graphic design and tattoos but if you're interested
          in my work or want to talk about our shared hobbies you can find my mail 
          and IG username down below! Also, in case you were wondering, there's
           no special meaning behind the word "INAN",
         it's just my nick and I thought it would be cool to put it in the project.
