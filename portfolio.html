            The creation of this lettering required a wide research
            over a lot of different styles, ranging from complex and articulated
            to simple and linear ones. After numerous sketches that aimed to mostly employ smooth 
            lines and shapes, I came to the realisation that focusing on more geometrical
            compositions came both easier and natural to me. During the early stages of planning the design
            got through many corrections and changes, since instead of constructing every
            letter from the same pool of shapes I opted to create them following a broad set
            of rules aimed to make them as cohesive as possible. The more common themes are
            the multiple "rays" that start from the same point used for the letters wich
            are mostly comprised by straight lines, and the combination of said rays with
            circumferences for letters that presented one or more curves. This specific
            lettering was not created for a specific usage, but given its characteristics
            and the fact that it becomes very hard to read when shrunk it is best suited 
            for titles or similar tasks that require a larger font size to maximise
            its impact on the reader.

            This project focuses around the theme of esotericism, a term that refers
            to sets of beliefs that are by their own nature "closed off" to the great majority of the population.
            This specific project was made for an hypotetical esoteric shop, a place that sells items
            related to various cults including, but not limited to, paganism, hinduism, wicca and buddhism.
            Given the great amount of cults and their vast usage of iconography, the hardest part of the project was
            choosing a very limited number of symbols to work with; for this purpose, the Baphomet and the eye
            were chosen given their widespread usage and recognizability even from people with no interest in the
            subject. The specific colors chosen are black, purple, gold and silver, both for their meaning and
            because of the chromatic combination.

            This school project, unfortunately interrupted, tasked us with the choice
        of a company that, thanks to the general aesthetics of its products,
        had caught our attention, giving us the inspiration
        for the development of a poster, a moodboard and some gadgets. 
        Since "SNEAK" produces energy drinks for gamers
        I opted for bright colors and regular and edgy shapes, characteristics
        frequently associated with the videogame scene. 
        During the early stages of the project
        I suggested many can designs that eventually became the ones shown above. 
        In the third picture you can see a draft of what would be 
        the final poster with a can model built in Blender and then inserted 
        in illustrator.

           Thanks to the full stack web development course I'm currently attending
           I've been able to develop this site writing both HTML and CSS code
           with the implementation of Bootstrap
           and SASS that allowed me a more methodical and less intricate approach to this whole 
           programming experience.
